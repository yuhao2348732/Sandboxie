Thank you for your contribution to the Sandboxie repository.

In order to reduce the risk of accidental merges, it's highly recommended for beginners to open a new Pull Request in draft state by clicking the button "Create Draft Pull Request", instead of using the default "Create Pull Request". You can convert an existing pull request to a draft by clicking the "Convert to draft" link in the right sidebar under "Reviewers".
