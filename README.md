# Sandboxie
Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

Sandboxie is available in two flavors, Plus and Classic. Both have the same core components, this means they have the same level of security and compatibility.
What's different is the availability of features in the user interface.

The Plus build has a modern Qt based UI, which supports all new features that have been added since the project went open source.
The Classic build has the old no longer developed MFC based UI, hence it lacks support for modern features. However, most of them can still be used when manually configured in the Sandboxie.ini configuration file.
